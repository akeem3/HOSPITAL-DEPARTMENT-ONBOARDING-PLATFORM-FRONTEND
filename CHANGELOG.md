## Development Notes

### Project Purpose

This platform was developed specifically for the **Maternity and Children Hospital, Buraidah**, Saudi Arabia, to address critical workflow challenges in staff training and interdepartmental consistency. It replaces outdated file-dumping methods with a structured, organized training portal.

### Key Benefits

1. **Eliminates Chaos**: Replaces unstructured file-sharing with organized, department-specific content
2. **Reduces Complaints**: Staff no longer need to raise tickets for missing resources
3. **Speeds Up Onboarding**: New hires can get up to speed quickly with clearly presented videos and documents
4. **Empowers Teams**: Admins can upload and manage content without technical help

### Technology Choices

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its excellent developer experience and production-ready features
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, consistent styling and responsive design
- **Radix UI**: For accessible, customizable component primitives
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: For robust form handling and validation

### Deployment Strategy

- Locally hosted via WampServer for secure, internal access
- No external dependencies for maximum security
- Designed for hospital network environment
